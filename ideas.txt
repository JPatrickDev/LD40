Theme: The more you have, the worse it is.

You start with X amount of something.
You have to get rid of it ASAP, you collect more over time.
At the end the less you have in your possession, the better your score.

Tetris type thing? :
Have to place pieces on the board, can't let it fill up
Also can't let your queue of placeable shapes fill up
Board could grow/shrink over time
    - Powerups to let you do that?
Could be colour based somehow?
    - Adjacent tiles of the same colour disappear
        - "opposite" colours cancel each other out maybe?
Score is based on your average number of tiles on the board, would help fit the theme.
    - Would definitely have to make the queue not filling up thing or a high score could be done by AFKing for ages
